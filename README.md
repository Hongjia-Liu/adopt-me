# Adopt Me

Corresponding project for Complete Intro to React v7 and Intermediate React v4 from Frontend Masters.

In this project, we start from the ground up with a barebone HTML file and build a real-world application using modern React.

We piece together tools from the entire React ecosystem, including:

- npm
- Prettier
- ESLint
- Git
- Parcel
- React Router
- TailwindCSS

We also get to using the latest features and best practices in React, including

- Hooks
- Effects
- Context
- Portals
- CSS-in-JS with TailwindCSS
- Performance improvement with code splitting
- Server-side rendering
- React with TypeScript
- State management with Redux
- Test with Jest
- and more!
